// This is the classic ***connect 4*** game where there are rounded two colored token (Red and Blue), there will be two player in the game User vs PC or User vs User.

// Pseudocode 
// 1- As the game starts it will ask user to choose the game mode (Player vs Player) or (Player vs Computer)

// 3- Game will start by showing empty grid of 7 columns and 6 rows rounded cells
// 4- The game will randomly choose which token color will start playing first.
// 5- Players will choose which of the 7 columns to drop the token, noting that filled columns should be skipped.
// 6- Players will be given turns in alternating way.
// 7- Winner is the first to have horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of 4 tokens.
// 8- If all the game board is filled then its a tie,
// 9- The game will have a counter of how many times each wins and when its a tie none will get a point.
// 10- There should be a button to restart the game.
// 11- There should be a button to "play another round", in that case the winning counter will keep adding.

// More Visual Effects
// 1- The game will have background sound playing in loop
// 2- Tokens will be animated when falling down into the selected column
// 3- Tokens will create sliding and hitting sounds effects,
// 4- When we have the game mode (Player vs computer) then if the player looses then play loose sound, if player wins play winning sound.
// 5- There should be a visual animated pop up showing the final results (ex. Red (0) - Blue (0))
// 6- The winning combination should be highlighted in different color, with swinging animation.
